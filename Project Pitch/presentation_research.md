# Research for Project Pitch

## Our Vision
A web application designed to streamline shared-house living by organising roommate schedules, distributing chores fairly, improving communication, and easing social interactions.

## Target Market 
International and Exchange Students - This group comprises over 400,000 international students in 2023, making up 40% of all tertiary enrollments, as reported by FET (2023) and NCBI (2024). Language barriers and the challenges of adapting to new environments make these students ideal users of the application, which can help them navigate shared living situations more easily.

Travellers - Travellers are known for having very irregular schedules and a strong openness to meeting new people. This demographic would benefit from the application by enabling them to manage their time and relationships more effectively while staying in shared accommodations.

People in Sharehomes - As rent prices continue to rise in Australia, there is a growing trend towards house-sharing, with 210,000 individuals seeking shared homes in just January 2024 alone, according to Flatmate (2024). This group would find the application useful for managing the logistical and social aspects of cohabitation.

## Current Market 
The current market lacks a comprehensive solution that integrates scheduling, chore management, and communication specifically tailored for shared living situations. Existing platforms offer individual features like family organization, smart home automation, or gamified chores, but they do not combine these elements into a single, cohesive tool designed to meet the unique needs of roommates or share homes. This creates a gap for a product that can streamline and simplify the complexities of shared household management.

Cozi Family Organizer: This platform is designed to help families keep track of everyone’s schedules, shopping lists, to-dos, and meal planning. It’s particularly popular among busy families who need to manage multiple schedules and tasks.

Homey – A Better Smart Home: Homey integrates various smart home devices into one app, allowing users to control everything from lights to thermostats. It is primarily focused on automating home environments rather than organizing household chores or roommate schedules.

Sweepy: Sweepy is an app that gamifies cleaning chores, assigning tasks and tracking completion to make household cleaning more engaging. It focuses mainly on chore management but lacks integration with other aspects of shared living, such as scheduling.

My Stuff Organizer: This app helps users keep track of their belongings, organizing items by room and category. It’s useful for inventory management but doesn’t address broader household coordination or communication needs.

Home Routines: Home Routines allows users to create checklists and set routines for household chores. It focuses on ensuring that tasks are completed regularly, but it doesn’t provide features for syncing schedules or improving roommate communication.

## Market Gap
The new product aims to fill this gap by:

Syncing Calendars: Ensuring that everyone’s schedules are aligned and visible to all roommates, making it easier to plan around each other’s activities.

Gamified Process: Similar to Sweepy, but more integrated with other household management features, this aspect will make chores and shared responsibilities more engaging by adding elements of gamification.

Current Manual Process: Many households still manage these aspects manually or across multiple platforms. The new product will streamline these processes into one app, reducing the need for manual coordination and improving the overall experience of shared living.

This combination of features will provide a more comprehensive solution for those living in shared homes, addressing the specific needs that are currently underserved by existing platforms.

## Feature Explanation
Our platform roomie consists of 4 main features which include the get to know page, shared calendar, house work distribution and anonymous rating system. 

The first get to know page allows the people living together to know more about other people interests, hobbies and personalities. This will also improve compatibility, provide conversation starters, and even builds a sense of safety. 

The second feature is calendar syncing. This screen allows people to share they’re weekly routines with each other so people actually know when their house mates are at home and also what days are free if they want to make any plans with each other. 

The third page is a house work allocator. As Daniel mentioned before some people still use a whiteboard and group chats to allocate sand assign chores. This feature we’re creating will allow random and fair allocation of chores and a clear way of seeing who’s in charge of what. 

The final feature is weekly reviews. We know that confrontation and bringing up issues can be difficult sometimes. So we’re creating a page where you can anonymously send a star rating with a comment if you want to send through a message to someone. 

## Tech Stack
The tech stack for the application includes React for the front-end. The back-end is powered by Node.js combined with Express, enabling a robust and scalable server-side environment. MongoDB is used as the database for storing and managing data. We will be using an algorith for the random chore allocator and an sdk for the calendar syncing. 

## Project Timeline
The project timeline is broken down into four sprints:

Sprint 0 focuses on collecting feedback on the user interface and user experience (UI/UX), ensuring that core functionalities operate without critical issues.
Sprint 1 involves performance testing to confirm the system can handle multiple users, along with making improvements and fixing bugs.
Sprint 2 continues refining functionalities, conducting more testing on key features, and further improving the user experience.
Sprint 3 is dedicated to finalizing reporting and documentation, as well as conducting end-to-end testing to ensure the product is ready.
